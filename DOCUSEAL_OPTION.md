## Recommendation

**For your use case, I'd recommend the custom solution instead** because:
- ✅ Simpler (no deployment needed)
- ✅ Faster (no external API)
- ✅ Free (no server costs)
- ✅ Sufficient for NDAs

But if you want a full platform, DocuSeal is great!

**Which do you prefer?** Custom solution or DocuSeal?
